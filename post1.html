   <title> The perfect way to start learning cybersecurity!</title>

    Ideas

    Is there a known way to learn CyberSecurity or a specific track?

    Which field inside CyberSecurity will be my career profession?

    The effective method to master your profession and the community!

    Watch out for getting overwhelmed 

    Repeat, avoid stopping 

    The cool bonus 



    First things first you should keep in mind there is no particular way or magical course or even boot camp that can make you the complete cyber guy, so do not waste your time and money with anyone who gives you a promise or hope to be the ultimate hackerman after finishing his course, Most of the special people in this field their started point was anything but not cybersecurity, for Example, Live0verflow he has begun with HTML!

if you are interested in watching his video The Secret step-by-step Guide to learn Hacking

Frans Rosén started as a developer and in 2019 he recorded 1 milion dollars with Hackerone.

John Hammond started with creating websites and learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Now he is a respected cybersecurity researcher and educator. He’s part of Huntress's Research & Development Threat Operations team, analyzing malware and making hackers earn their access. Previously, he was an instructor at the Department of Defense Cyber Training Academy.

    If everyone were to leap directly into cybersecurity without the wealth of prior tech experiences, they might not stand out as uniquely skilled. 🌟


For those who are new to this field and wonder why they should learn seemingly unrelated concepts instead of diving straight into security, imagine your task is to break into a building. Without understanding the details of its construction such as the materials used, the types of locks, and the overall design, you’d face significant challenges. It is essential to know the building’s exits and entrances, study its layout, and grasp the underlying architecture. Similarly, in the world of technology, foundational knowledge provides the keys to unlocking specialized areas like cybersecurity.


Then, you can start learning anything from the basics of web dev (HTML, CSS, JS) and pick one high-level programming language as a beginner such as Python, making your learning based on projects even if you just learned simple things, Try to create different web applications with different services, you will face many errors in your coding journey and that's an advantage for you to understand how it works how it communicates.

2.  Assuming you’ve mastered the basics, which specific career paths within cybersecurity are you planning to pursue? 🛡️🔍

To determine the best specialization that aligns with your interests, consider exploring the working styles of various areas within cybersecurity. For instance, if you’re intrigued by penetration testing, immerse yourself in a video that showcases a day in the life of a Pentester. Take notes on their daily tasks, requirements, and duties. Understand the challenges they encounter. This firsthand insight will help you make an informed decision about your specialization. 🛡️🔍🌟


 

 3.   Active learning is incredibly effective. When you delve into a topic like reconnaissance, don’t merely absorb information passively. Instead:

    Practice Hands-On: Apply what you’ve learned immediately. Experiment with tools, perform scans and explore networks.

    Take Notes: Whether it’s a plain notepad, or a digital tool like Notion, or Obsidian, jot down key details. Capture short terms, commands, and insights.

    Track Progress: Regularly review your notes. Observe how your understanding evolves. Remember, learning is an adventure—take those practical steps and document your journey! 🚀🔍📝

    The last thing you have to do is get involved in the community, if you want to quickly advance in cybersecurity, actively participate in the community:
    This involvement will help you grow and open up new opportunities. 🚀

    Network: Join cybersecurity groups and attend industry events.

    Learn: Engage in forums, read blogs, and follow news. (stay up-to-date)

    Share: Contribute to discussions on social media.

    Volunteer: Help out in cyber volunteer programs.





4. To avoid feeling overwhelmed while studying cybersecurity, consider these strategies:

    Break Down the Material: Tackle one topic at a time to avoid information overload.

    Set Realistic Goals: Create a study schedule with achievable targets.

    Practice Regularly: Apply what you learn through hands-on exercises.

    Seek Support: Join study groups or online communities for motivation and assistance.

    Consider leveraging playful platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe to explore and learn hacking interactively and enjoyably. 🎮🔐

    Take Breaks: Regular intervals of rest can help maintain focus and prevent burnout.

    Stay Healthy: Ensure you get enough sleep and exercise.


5.  Repeat, avoid stopping 



6.  Finally, To recharge your ignite of passion use the learning reward system when you finish your daily missions reward yourself with something you enjoy like playing your favorite game or watching your TV show my advice and the main reason I wanted to mention this bonus part at the end is I highly recommend that you pick a movie or tv series related to cybersecurity and make sure it's realistic, that's will make you always exciting to keep going learning about your field and discover more and here is some suggestions:

    Scorpion 

    Mr. Robot

    De Kraak

    Black Hat

    Whoami

    Chuck

    Snowden

The upcoming post will focus on the ideal resources for learning. 📚🌐
